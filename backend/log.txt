        'In this project, our team of six people with two developers, one UX specialist, one environment designer, one 3D modeller and a project manager undertook a mission to develop an immersive virtual reality experience to train upcoming mechanics to replace a battery electric vehicle main battery. Our client was for the Vancouver Community College’s automotive training program, and we wanted to best replicate a realistic Ev battery simulation that complies with their standards for properly and in an engaging way, train students to perform the task and practice in a safe controlled environment before allowing them to perform the task in a real setting.\n' +

        '            The hoist with functional buttons and multimeter with functional dials and voltage capture. The hoist behaves exactly as the one shown by our client at VCC. The big button lifts the load, a small lever near the hydraulic tank lowers the hoist and a safety interlock mechanically latches the vehicle based on preset spots on the lift, locking it securely in the event of hydraulics failure. I also worked on the Multimeter, implementing the process of connecting and disconnecting the leads onto the terminal, having a functional display mimicking the tested voltage and giving objects a “voltage” that can be probed by the Multimeter to accurately mimic a working multimeter. This was used in the later stages of the project to reduce the crunch time needed to resolve issues with implementation as the Multimeter and Hoist are one of the hardest to implement and implementing it during a time of reduced motivation near the end would not be ideal. Additionally, I also utilised components that my teammates also worked on. This includes the UX flow and how players should be introduced to each component through research and testing by the UX Specialist, replacing low fidelity prototypes developed by myself or placeholders with actual HD models, compiling documentation for the Project Manager and merging components built by other developers. \n' +

        '            As the project expanded and more components started to have dependencies on other components, we needed a way to consolidate everything together and reorganise the codebase. One solution is to use Object Oriented Programming to implement a Mission Manager system. We start with a Mission Manager that keeps track of all tasks. Each Task inherits a base class called a Task Supervisor. It has its own implementation along with inherited methods to keep track of the current Tasks and triggered Colliders that cue the next set of actions to be taken. Once all the subtasks inside of a Task are completed, a call to Mission Manager is made to tell the Manager to cue the next Task and disable everything that is used in that Task to save system resources. For each task, a set of events (EventTrigger_C) is executed to allow for the display of UI elements for the UX flow, and to set up object states for the current or next subtask. Each EventTrigger_C has two fields, TGB() and UI Only(). TGB() events are triggered regardless of whether or not it is a UI element. These events set up the required elements; for example the position of the hoist, or the player’s position. UI Only events are concerned for the display of vital UI elements for the purposes of the training and tutorial mode in the game, where players are provided UI cues to aid in the dissemination of vital training information. \n' +

They set up the model, pass arguments through the linear algebra functions to set up the view and projection matrices and transform them to view space to be displayed on screen. The only concern is that for many objects in scene, we have to do that for every single object, so we use OOP to streamline and modularize the project for larger scenes, inspired by Unity's GameObject and Scene system.\n" +

        '\n' +
        'In this project, our team of six people with two developers, one UX specialist, one environment designer, one 3D modeller and a project manager undertook a mission to develop an immersive virtual reality experience to train upcoming mechanics to replace a battery electric vehicle main battery. Our client was for the Vancouver Community College’s automotive training program, and we wanted to best replicate a realistic Ev battery simulation that complies with their standards for properly and in an engaging way, train students to perform the task and practice in a safe controlled environment before allowing them to perform the task in a real setting.\n' +
        '            <h3>Contribution</h3>\n' +
        '            The hoist with functional buttons and multimeter with functional dials and voltage capture. The hoist behaves exactly as the one shown by our client at VCC. The big button lifts the load, a small lever near the hydraulic tank lowers the hoist and a safety interlock mechanically latches the vehicle based on preset spots on the lift, locking it securely in the event of hydraulics failure. I also worked on the Multimeter, implementing the process of connecting and disconnecting the leads onto the terminal, having a functional display mimicking the tested voltage and giving objects a “voltage” that can be probed by the Multimeter to accurately mimic a working multimeter. This was used in the later stages of the project to reduce the crunch time needed to resolve issues with implementation as the Multimeter and Hoist are one of the hardest to implement and implementing it during a time of reduced motivation near the end would not be ideal. Additionally, I also utilised components that my teammates also worked on. This includes the UX flow and how players should be introduced to each component through research and testing by the UX Specialist, replacing low fidelity prototypes developed by myself or placeholders with actual HD models, compiling documentation for the Project Manager and merging components built by other developers. \n' +
        '            <h3>Code Consolidation and Mission Manager</h3>\n' +
        '            As the project expanded and more components started to have dependencies on other components, we needed a way to consolidate everything together and reorganise the codebase. One solution is to use Object Oriented Programming to implement a Mission Manager system. We start with a Mission Manager that keeps track of all tasks. Each Task inherits a base class called a Task Supervisor. It has its own implementation along with inherited methods to keep track of the current Tasks and triggered Colliders that cue the next set of actions to be taken. Once all the subtasks inside of a Task are completed, a call to Mission Manager is made to tell the Manager to cue the next Task and disable everything that is used in that Task to save system resources. For each task, a set of events (EventTrigger_C) is executed to allow for the display of UI elements for the UX flow, and to set up object states for the current or next subtask.

        '            <h3>Project Overview</h3> \n' +
        '\n' +
        'In this project, our team of six people with two developers, one UX specialist, one environment designer, one 3D modeller and a project manager undertook a mission to develop an immersive virtual reality experience to train upcoming mechanics to replace a battery electric vehicle main battery. Our client was for the Vancouver Community College’s automotive training program, and we wanted to best replicate a realistic Ev battery simulation that complies with their standards for properly and in an engaging way, train students to perform the task and practice in a safe controlled environment before allowing them to perform the task in a real setting.\n' +
        '            <h3>Contribution</h3>\n' +
        '            The hoist with functional buttons and multimeter with functional dials and voltage capture. The hoist behaves exactly as the one shown by our client at VCC. The big button lifts the load, a small lever near the hydraulic tank lowers the hoist and a safety interlock mechanically latches the vehicle based on preset spots on the lift, locking it securely in the event of hydraulics failure. I also worked on the Multimeter, implementing the process of connecting and disconnecting the leads onto the terminal, having a functional display mimicking the tested voltage and giving objects a “voltage” that can be probed by the Multimeter to accurately mimic a working multimeter. This was used in the later stages of the project to reduce the crunch time needed to resolve issues with implementation as the Multimeter and Hoist are one of the hardest to implement and implementing it during a time of reduced motivation near the end would not be ideal. Additionally, I also utilised components that my teammates also worked on. This includes the UX flow and how players should be introduced to each component through research and testing by the UX Specialist, replacing low fidelity prototypes developed by myself or placeholders with actual HD models, compiling documentation for the Project Manager and merging components built by other developers. \n' +
        '            <h3>Code Consolidation and Mission Manager</h3>\n' +
        '            As the project expanded and more components started to have dependencies on other components, we needed a way to consolidate everything together and reorganise the codebase. One solution is to use Object Oriented Programming to implement a Mission Manager system. We start with a Mission Manager that keeps track of all tasks. Each Task inherits a base class called a Task Supervisor. It has its own implementation along with inherited methods to keep track of the current Tasks and triggered Colliders that cue the next set of actions to be taken. Once all the subtasks inside of a Task are completed, a call to Mission Manager is made to tell the Manager to cue the next Task and disable everything that is used in that Task to save system resources. For each task, a set of events (EventTrigger_C) is executed to allow for the display of UI elements for the UX flow, and to set up object states for the current or next subtask. Each EventTrigger_C has two fields, TGB() and UI Only(). TGB() events are triggered regardless of whether or not it is a UI element. These events set up the required elements; for example the position of the hoist, or the player’s position. UI Only events are concerned for the display of vital UI elements for the purposes of the training and tutorial mode in the game, where players are provided UI cues to aid in the dissemination of vital training information. \n' +

        '            As the project expanded and more components started to have dependencies on other components, we needed a way to consolidate everything together and reorganise the codebase. One solution is to use Object Oriented Programming to implement a Mission Manager system. We start with a Mission Manager that keeps track of all tasks. Each Task inherits a base class called a Task Supervisor. It has its own implementation along with inherited methods to keep track of the current Tasks and triggered Colliders that cue the next set of actions to be taken. Once all the subtasks inside of a Task are completed, a call to Mission Manager is made to tell the Manager to cue the next Task and disable everything that is used in that Task to save system resources. For each task, a set of events (EventTrigger_C) is executed to allow for the display of UI elements for the UX flow, and to set up object states for the current or next subtask. Each EventTrigger_C has two fields, TGB() and UI Only(). TGB() events are triggered regardless of whether or not it is a UI element. These events set up the required elements; for example the position of the hoist, or the player’s position. UI Only events are concerned for the display of vital UI elements for the purposes of the training and tutorial mode in the game, where players are provided UI cues to aid in the dissemination of vital training information. \n' +

        'PlantScan is a standalone web application designed for AVA Grows hydroponics management company, and it will allow users to identify a plant and analyze its health through a photo. Users will be able to login, take and upload photos of their plants to the application. The photos will be analyzed through the plant identification API [Plant.id] (https://web.plant.id/), which utilizes machine learning to identify the type of plant in the photo and also return any potential stressors, such as unusual coloration, growing mold, or the presence of pests. Users will also be able to filter photos by tags, such as plants with flowers. With our application, we aim to make caring for plants more easily accessible to plant owners, as well as provide a scaffolding for AVA Grows to integrate a similar technology into their existing platform.\n' +

        '            <h3>Project Overview</h3> \n' +
        '\n' +
        'In this project, our team of six people with two developers, one UX specialist, one environment designer, one 3D modeller and a project manager undertook a mission to develop an immersive virtual reality experience to train upcoming mechanics to replace a battery electric vehicle main battery. Our client was for the Vancouver Community College’s automotive training program, and we wanted to best replicate a realistic Ev battery simulation that complies with their standards for properly and in an engaging way, train students to perform the task and practice in a safe controlled environment before allowing them to perform the task in a real setting.\n' +
        '            <h3>Contribution</h3>\n' +
        '            The hoist with functional buttons and multimeter with functional dials and voltage capture. The hoist behaves exactly as the one shown by our client at VCC. The big button lifts the load, a small lever near the hydraulic tank lowers the hoist and a safety interlock mechanically latches the vehicle based on preset spots on the lift, locking it securely in the event of hydraulics failure. I also worked on the Multimeter, implementing the process of connecting and disconnecting the leads onto the terminal, having a functional display mimicking the tested voltage and giving objects a “voltage” that can be probed by the Multimeter to accurately mimic a working multimeter. This was used in the later stages of the project to reduce the crunch time needed to resolve issues with implementation as the Multimeter and Hoist are one of the hardest to implement and implementing it during a time of reduced motivation near the end would not be ideal. Additionally, I also utilised components that my teammates also worked on. This includes the UX flow and how players should be introduced to each component through research and testing by the UX Specialist, replacing low fidelity prototypes developed by myself or placeholders with actual HD models, compiling documentation for the Project Manager and merging components built by other developers. \n' +
        '            <h3>Code Consolidation and Mission Manager</h3>\n' +
        '            As the project expanded and more components started to have dependencies on other components, we needed a way to consolidate everything together and reorganise the codebase. One solution is to use Object Oriented Programming to implement a Mission Manager system. We start with a Mission Manager that keeps track of all tasks. Each Task inherits a base class called a Task Supervisor. It has its own implementation along with inherited methods to keep track of the current Tasks and triggered Colliders that cue the next set of actions to be taken. Once all the subtasks inside of a Task are completed, a call to Mission Manager is made to tell the Manager to cue the next Task and disable everything that is used in that Task to save system resources. For each task, a set of events (EventTrigger_C) is executed to allow for the display of UI elements for the UX flow, and to set up object states for the current or next subtask. Each EventTrigger_C has two fields, TGB() and UI Only(). TGB() events are triggered regardless of whether or not it is a UI element. These events set up the required elements; for example the position of the hoist, or the player’s position. UI Only events are concerned for the display of vital UI elements for the purposes of the training and tutorial mode in the game, where players are provided UI cues to aid in the dissemination of vital training information. \n' +

        'In this project, our team of six people with two developers, one UX specialist, one environment designer, one 3D modeller and a project manager undertook a mission to develop an immersive virtual reality experience to train upcoming mechanics to replace a battery electric vehicle main battery. Our client was for the Vancouver Community College’s automotive training program, and we wanted to best replicate a realistic Ev battery simulation that complies with their standards for properly and in an engaging way, train students to perform the task and practice in a safe controlled environment before allowing them to perform the task in a real setting.\n' +

        '            The hoist with functional buttons and multimeter with functional dials and voltage capture. The hoist behaves exactly as the one shown by our client at VCC. The big button lifts the load, a small lever near the hydraulic tank lowers the hoist and a safety interlock mechanically latches the vehicle based on preset spots on the lift, locking it securely in the event of hydraulics failure. I also worked on the Multimeter, implementing the process of connecting and disconnecting the leads onto the terminal, having a functional display mimicking the tested voltage and giving objects a “voltage” that can be probed by the Multimeter to accurately mimic a working multimeter. This was used in the later stages of the project to reduce the crunch time needed to resolve issues with implementation as the Multimeter and Hoist are one of the hardest to implement and implementing it during a time of reduced motivation near the end would not be ideal. Additionally, I also utilised components that my teammates also worked on. This includes the UX flow and how players should be introduced to each component through research and testing by the UX Specialist, replacing low fidelity prototypes developed by myself or placeholders with actual HD models, compiling documentation for the Project Manager and merging components built by other developers. \n' +

        '            As the project expanded and more components started to have dependencies on other components, we needed a way to consolidate everything together and reorganise the codebase. One solution is to use Object Oriented Programming to implement a Mission Manager system. We start with a Mission Manager that keeps track of all tasks. Each Task inherits a base class called a Task Supervisor. It has its own implementation along with inherited methods to keep track of the current Tasks and triggered Colliders that cue the next set of actions to be taken. Once all the subtasks inside of a Task are completed, a call to Mission Manager is made to tell the Manager to cue the next Task and disable everything that is used in that Task to save system resources. For each task, a set of events (EventTrigger_C) is executed to allow for the display of UI elements for the UX flow, and to set up object states for the current or next subtask. Each EventTrigger_C has two fields, TGB() and UI Only(). TGB() events are triggered regardless of whether or not it is a UI element. These events set up the required elements; for example the position of the hoist, or the player’s position. UI Only events are concerned for the display of vital UI elements for the purposes of the training and tutorial mode in the game, where players are provided UI cues to aid in the dissemination of vital training information. \n' +

        '            <h3>Project Overview</h3> \n' +
        '\n' +
        'In this project, our team of six people with two developers, one UX specialist, one environment designer, one 3D modeller and a project manager undertook a mission to develop an immersive virtual reality experience to train upcoming mechanics to replace a battery electric vehicle main battery. Our client was for the Vancouver Community College’s automotive training program, and we wanted to best replicate a realistic Ev battery simulation that complies with their standards for properly and in an engaging way, train students to perform the task and practice in a safe controlled environment before allowing them to perform the task in a real setting.\n' +
        '            <h3>Contribution</h3>\n' +
        '            The hoist with functional buttons and multimeter with functional dials and voltage capture. The hoist behaves exactly as the one shown by our client at VCC. The big button lifts the load, a small lever near the hydraulic tank lowers the hoist and a safety interlock mechanically latches the vehicle based on preset spots on the lift, locking it securely in the event of hydraulics failure. I also worked on the Multimeter, implementing the process of connecting and disconnecting the leads onto the terminal, having a functional display mimicking the tested voltage and giving objects a “voltage” that can be probed by the Multimeter to accurately mimic a working multimeter. This was used in the later stages of the project to reduce the crunch time needed to resolve issues with implementation as the Multimeter and Hoist are one of the hardest to implement and implementing it during a time of reduced motivation near the end would not be ideal. Additionally, I also utilised components that my teammates also worked on. This includes the UX flow and how players should be introduced to each component through research and testing by the UX Specialist, replacing low fidelity prototypes developed by myself or placeholders with actual HD models, compiling documentation for the Project Manager and merging components built by other developers. \n' +
        '            <h3>Code Consolidation and Mission Manager</h3>\n' +
        '            As the project expanded and more components started to have dependencies on other components, we needed a way to consolidate everything together and reorganise the codebase. One solution is to use Object Oriented Programming to implement a Mission Manager system. We start with a Mission Manager that keeps track of all tasks. Each Task inherits a base class called a Task Supervisor. It has its own implementation along with inherited methods to keep track of the current Tasks and triggered Colliders that cue the next set of actions to be taken. Once all the subtasks inside of a Task are completed, a call to Mission Manager is made to tell the Manager to cue the next Task and disable everything that is used in that Task to save system resources. For each task, a set of events (EventTrigger_C) is executed to allow for the display of UI elements for the UX flow, and to set up object states for the current or next subtask. Each EventTrigger_C has two fields, TGB() and UI Only(). TGB() events are triggered regardless of whether or not it is a UI element. These events set up the required elements; for example the position of the hoist, or the player’s position. UI Only events are concerned for the display of vital UI elements for the purposes of the training and tutorial mode in the game, where players are provided UI cues to aid in the dissemination of vital training information. \n' +

        '            <h3>Project Overview</h3> \n' +
        '\n' +
        'In this project, our team of six people with two developers, one UX specialist, one environment designer, one 3D modeller and a project manager undertook a mission to develop an immersive virtual reality experience to train upcoming mechanics to replace a battery electric vehicle main battery. Our client was for the Vancouver Community College’s automotive training program, and we wanted to best replicate a realistic Ev battery simulation that complies with their standards for properly and in an engaging way, train students to perform the task and practice in a safe controlled environment before allowing them to perform the task in a real setting.\n' +
        '            <h3>Contribution</h3>\n' +
        '            The hoist with functional buttons and multimeter with functional dials and voltage capture. The hoist behaves exactly as the one shown by our client at VCC. The big button lifts the load, a small lever near the hydraulic tank lowers the hoist and a safety interlock mechanically latches the vehicle based on preset spots on the lift, locking it securely in the event of hydraulics failure. I also worked on the Multimeter, implementing the process of connecting and disconnecting the leads onto the terminal, having a functional display mimicking the tested voltage and giving objects a “voltage” that can be probed by the Multimeter to accurately mimic a working multimeter. This was used in the later stages of the project to reduce the crunch time needed to resolve issues with implementation as the Multimeter and Hoist are one of the hardest to implement and implementing it during a time of reduced motivation near the end would not be ideal. Additionally, I also utilised components that my teammates also worked on. This includes the UX flow and how players should be introduced to each component through research and testing by the UX Specialist, replacing low fidelity prototypes developed by myself or placeholders with actual HD models, compiling documentation for the Project Manager and merging components built by other developers. \n' +
        '            <h3>Code Consolidation and Mission Manager</h3>\n' +
        '            As the project expanded and more components started to have dependencies on other components, we needed a way to consolidate everything together and reorganise the codebase. One solution is to use Object Oriented Programming to implement a Mission Manager system. We start with a Mission Manager that keeps track of all tasks. Each Task inherits a base class called a Task Supervisor. It has its own implementation along with inherited methods to keep track of the current Tasks and triggered Colliders that cue the next set of actions to be taken. Once all the subtasks inside of a Task are completed, a call to Mission Manager is made to tell the Manager to cue the next Task and disable everything that is used in that Task to save system resources. For each task, a set of events (EventTrigger_C) is executed to allow for the display of UI elements for the UX flow, and to set up object states for the current or next subtask. Each EventTrigger_C has two fields, TGB() and UI Only(). TGB() events are triggered regardless of whether or not it is a UI element. These events set up the required elements; for example the position of the hoist, or the player’s position. UI Only events are concerned for the display of vital UI elements for the purposes of the training and tutorial mode in the game, where players are provided UI cues to aid in the dissemination of vital training information. \n' +

        'In this project, our team of six people with two developers, one UX specialist, one environment designer, one 3D modeller and a project manager undertook a mission to develop an immersive virtual reality experience to train upcoming mechanics to replace a battery electric vehicle main battery. Our client was for the Vancouver Community College’s automotive training program, and we wanted to best replicate a realistic Ev battery simulation that complies with their standards for properly and in an engaging way, train students to perform the task and practice in a safe controlled environment before allowing them to perform the task in a real setting.\n' +
        '            <h3>Contribution</h3>\n' +
        '            The hoist with functional buttons and multimeter with functional dials and voltage capture. The hoist behaves exactly as the one shown by our client at VCC. The big button lifts the load, a small lever near the hydraulic tank lowers the hoist and a safety interlock mechanically latches the vehicle based on preset spots on the lift, locking it securely in the event of hydraulics failure. I also worked on the Multimeter, implementing the process of connecting and disconnecting the leads onto the terminal, having a functional display mimicking the tested voltage and giving objects a “voltage” that can be probed by the Multimeter to accurately mimic a working multimeter. This was used in the later stages of the project to reduce the crunch time needed to resolve issues with implementation as the Multimeter and Hoist are one of the hardest to implement and implementing it during a time of reduced motivation near the end would not be ideal. Additionally, I also utilised components that my teammates also worked on. This includes the UX flow and how players should be introduced to each component through research and testing by the UX Specialist, replacing low fidelity prototypes developed by myself or placeholders with actual HD models, compiling documentation for the Project Manager and merging components built by other developers. \n' +

        '            As the project expanded and more components started to have dependencies on other components, we needed a way to consolidate everything together and reorganise the codebase. One solution is to use Object Oriented Programming to implement a Mission Manager system. We start with a Mission Manager that keeps track of all tasks. Each Task inherits a base class called a Task Supervisor. It has its own implementation along with inherited methods to keep track of the current Tasks and triggered Colliders that cue the next set of actions to be taken. Once all the subtasks inside of a Task are completed, a call to Mission Manager is made to tell the Manager to cue the next Task and disable everything that is used in that Task to save system resources. For each task, a set of events (EventTrigger_C) is executed to allow for the display of UI elements for the UX flow, and to set up object states for the current or next subtask. Each EventTrigger_C has two fields, TGB() and UI Only(). TGB() events are triggered regardless of whether or not it is a UI element. These events set up the required elements; for example the position of the hoist, or the player’s position. UI Only events are concerned for the display of vital UI elements for the purposes of the training and tutorial mode in the game, where players are provided UI cues to aid in the dissemination of vital training information. \n' +

They set up the model, pass arguments through the linear algebra functions to set up the view and projection matrices and transform them to view space to be displayed on screen. The only concern is that for many objects in scene, we have to do that for every single object, so we use OOP to streamline and modularize the project for larger scenes, inspired by Unity's GameObject and Scene system.\n" +

        '            <h3>Project Overview</h3> \n' +
        '\n' +
        'In this project, our team of six people with two developers, one UX specialist, one environment designer, one 3D modeller and a project manager undertook a mission to develop an immersive virtual reality experience to train upcoming mechanics to replace a battery electric vehicle main battery. Our client was for the Vancouver Community College’s automotive training program, and we wanted to best replicate a realistic Ev battery simulation that complies with their standards for properly and in an engaging way, train students to perform the task and practice in a safe controlled environment before allowing them to perform the task in a real setting.\n' +
        '            <h3>Contribution</h3>\n' +
        '            The hoist with functional buttons and multimeter with functional dials and voltage capture. The hoist behaves exactly as the one shown by our client at VCC. The big button lifts the load, a small lever near the hydraulic tank lowers the hoist and a safety interlock mechanically latches the vehicle based on preset spots on the lift, locking it securely in the event of hydraulics failure. I also worked on the Multimeter, implementing the process of connecting and disconnecting the leads onto the terminal, having a functional display mimicking the tested voltage and giving objects a “voltage” that can be probed by the Multimeter to accurately mimic a working multimeter. This was used in the later stages of the project to reduce the crunch time needed to resolve issues with implementation as the Multimeter and Hoist are one of the hardest to implement and implementing it during a time of reduced motivation near the end would not be ideal. Additionally, I also utilised components that my teammates also worked on. This includes the UX flow and how players should be introduced to each component through research and testing by the UX Specialist, replacing low fidelity prototypes developed by myself or placeholders with actual HD models, compiling documentation for the Project Manager and merging components built by other developers. \n' +
        '            <h3>Code Consolidation and Mission Manager</h3>\n' +
        '            As the project expanded and more components started to have dependencies on other components, we needed a way to consolidate everything together and reorganise the codebase. One solution is to use Object Oriented Programming to implement a Mission Manager system. We start with a Mission Manager that keeps track of all tasks. Each Task inherits a base class called a Task Supervisor. It has its own implementation along with inherited methods to keep track of the current Tasks and triggered Colliders that cue the next set of actions to be taken. Once all the subtasks inside of a Task are completed, a call to Mission Manager is made to tell the Manager to cue the next Task and disable everything that is used in that Task to save system resources. For each task, a set of events (EventTrigger_C) is executed to allow for the display of UI elements for the UX flow, and to set up object states for the current or next subtask. Each EventTrigger_C has two fields, TGB() and UI Only(). TGB() events are triggered regardless of whether or not it is a UI element. These events set up the required elements; for example the position of the hoist, or the player’s position. UI Only events are concerned for the display of vital UI elements for the purposes of the training and tutorial mode in the game, where players are provided UI cues to aid in the dissemination of vital training information. \n' +

        '            <h3>Project Overview</h3> \n' +
        '\n' +
        'In this project, our team of six people with two developers, one UX specialist, one environment designer, one 3D modeller and a project manager undertook a mission to develop an immersive virtual reality experience to train upcoming mechanics to replace a battery electric vehicle main battery. Our client was for the Vancouver Community College’s automotive training program, and we wanted to best replicate a realistic Ev battery simulation that complies with their standards for properly and in an engaging way, train students to perform the task and practice in a safe controlled environment before allowing them to perform the task in a real setting.\n' +
        '            <h3>Contribution</h3>\n' +
        '            The hoist with functional buttons and multimeter with functional dials and voltage capture. The hoist behaves exactly as the one shown by our client at VCC. The big button lifts the load, a small lever near the hydraulic tank lowers the hoist and a safety interlock mechanically latches the vehicle based on preset spots on the lift, locking it securely in the event of hydraulics failure. I also worked on the Multimeter, implementing the process of connecting and disconnecting the leads onto the terminal, having a functional display mimicking the tested voltage and giving objects a “voltage” that can be probed by the Multimeter to accurately mimic a working multimeter. This was used in the later stages of the project to reduce the crunch time needed to resolve issues with implementation as the Multimeter and Hoist are one of the hardest to implement and implementing it during a time of reduced motivation near the end would not be ideal. Additionally, I also utilised components that my teammates also worked on. This includes the UX flow and how players should be introduced to each component through research and testing by the UX Specialist, replacing low fidelity prototypes developed by myself or placeholders with actual HD models, compiling documentation for the Project Manager and merging components built by other developers. \n' +
        '            <h3>Code Consolidation and Mission Manager</h3>\n' +
        '            As the project expanded and more components started to have dependencies on other components, we needed a way to consolidate everything together and reorganise the codebase. One solution is to use Object Oriented Programming to implement a Mission Manager system. We start with a Mission Manager that keeps track of all tasks. Each Task inherits a base class called a Task Supervisor. It has its own implementation along with inherited methods to keep track of the current Tasks and triggered Colliders that cue the next set of actions to be taken. Once all the subtasks inside of a Task are completed, a call to Mission Manager is made to tell the Manager to cue the next Task and disable everything that is used in that Task to save system resources. For each task, a set of events (EventTrigger_C) is executed to allow for the display of UI elements for the UX flow, and to set up object states for the current or next subtask. Each EventTrigger_C has two fields, TGB() and UI Only(). TGB() events are triggered regardless of whether or not it is a UI element. These events set up the required elements; for example the position of the hoist, or the player’s position. UI Only events are concerned for the display of vital UI elements for the purposes of the training and tutorial mode in the game, where players are provided UI cues to aid in the dissemination of vital training information. \n' +

Our client was for the Vancouver Community College’s automotive training program, and we wanted to best replicate a realistic Ev battery simulation that complies with their standards for properly and in an engaging way, train students to perform the task and practice in a safe controlled environment before allowing them to perform the task in a real setting.\n' +

        '            The hoist with functional buttons and multimeter with functional dials and voltage capture. The hoist behaves exactly as the one shown by our client at VCC. The big button lifts the load, a small lever near the hydraulic tank lowers the hoist and a safety interlock mechanically latches the vehicle based on preset spots on the lift, locking it securely in the event of hydraulics failure. I also worked on the Multimeter, implementing the process of connecting and disconnecting the leads onto the terminal, having a functional display mimicking the tested voltage and giving objects a “voltage” that can be probed by the Multimeter to accurately mimic a working multimeter. This was used in the later stages of the project to reduce the crunch time needed to resolve issues with implementation as the Multimeter and Hoist are one of the hardest to implement and implementing it during a time of reduced motivation near the end would not be ideal. Additionally, I also utilised components that my teammates also worked on.

        '            As the project expanded and more components started to have dependencies on other components, we needed a way to consolidate everything together and reorganise the codebase. One solution is to use Object Oriented Programming to implement a Mission Manager system. We start with a Mission Manager that keeps track of all tasks. Each Task inherits a base class called a Task Supervisor. It has its own implementation along with inherited methods to keep track of the current Tasks and triggered Colliders that cue the next set of actions to be taken. Once all the subtasks inside of a Task are completed, a call to Mission Manager is made to tell the Manager to cue the next Task and disable everything that is used in that Task to save system resources. For each task, a set of events (EventTrigger_C) is executed to allow for the display of UI elements for the UX flow, and to set up object states for the current or next subtask. Each EventTrigger_C has two fields, TGB() and UI Only(). TGB() events are triggered regardless of whether or not it is a UI element. These events set up the required elements; for example the position of the hoist, or the player’s position. UI Only events are concerned for the display of vital UI elements for the purposes of the training and tutorial mode in the game, where players are provided UI cues to aid in the dissemination of vital training information. \n' +

        '\n' +
        'In this project, our team of six people with two developers, one UX specialist, one environment designer, one 3D modeller and a project manager undertook a mission to develop an immersive virtual reality experience to train upcoming mechanics to replace a battery electric vehicle main battery. Our client was for the Vancouver Community College’s automotive training program, and we wanted to best replicate a realistic Ev battery simulation that complies with their standards for properly and in an engaging way, train students to perform the task and practice in a safe controlled environment before allowing them to perform the task in a real setting.\n' +
        '            <h3>Contribution</h3>\n' +
        '            The hoist with functional buttons and multimeter with functional dials and voltage capture. The hoist behaves exactly as the one shown by our client at VCC. The big button lifts the load, a small lever near the hydraulic tank lowers the hoist and a safety interlock mechanically latches the vehicle based on preset spots on the lift, locking it securely in the event of hydraulics failure. I also worked on the Multimeter, implementing the process of connecting and disconnecting the leads onto the terminal, having a functional display mimicking the tested voltage and giving objects a “voltage” that can be probed by the Multimeter to accurately mimic a working multimeter. This was used in the later stages of the project to reduce the crunch time needed to resolve issues with implementation as the Multimeter and Hoist are one of the hardest to implement and implementing it during a time of reduced motivation near the end would not be ideal. Additionally, I also utilised components that my teammates also worked on. This includes the UX flow and how players should be introduced to each component through research and testing by the UX Specialist, replacing low fidelity prototypes developed by myself or placeholders with actual HD models, compiling documentation for the Project Manager and merging components built by other developers. \n' +
        '            <h3>Code Consolidation and Mission Manager</h3>\n' +
        '            As the project expanded and more components started to have dependencies on other components, we needed a way to consolidate everything together and reorganise the codebase. One solution is to use Object Oriented Programming to implement a Mission Manager system. We start with a Mission Manager that keeps track of all tasks. Each Task inherits a base class called a Task Supervisor. It has its own implementation along with inherited methods to keep track of the current Tasks and triggered Colliders that cue the next set of actions to be taken. Once all the subtasks inside of a Task are completed, a call to Mission Manager is made to tell the Manager to cue the next Task and disable everything that is used in that Task to save system resources. For each task, a set of events (EventTrigger_C) is executed to allow for the display of UI elements for the UX flow, and to set up object states for the current or next subtask. Each EventTrigger_C has two fields, TGB() and UI Only(). TGB() events are triggered regardless of whether or not it is a UI element.

        '            <h3>Project Overview</h3> \n' +
        '\n' +
        'In this project, our team of six people with two developers, one UX specialist, one environment designer, one 3D modeller and a project manager undertook a mission to develop an immersive virtual reality experience to train upcoming mechanics to replace a battery electric vehicle main battery. Our client was for the Vancouver Community College’s automotive training program, and we wanted to best replicate a realistic Ev battery simulation that complies with their standards for properly and in an engaging way, train students to perform the task and practice in a safe controlled environment before allowing them to perform the task in a real setting.\n' +
        '            <h3>Contribution</h3>\n' +
        '            The hoist with functional buttons and multimeter with functional dials and voltage capture. The hoist behaves exactly as the one shown by our client at VCC. The big button lifts the load, a small lever near the hydraulic tank lowers the hoist and a safety interlock mechanically latches the vehicle based on preset spots on the lift, locking it securely in the event of hydraulics failure. I also worked on the Multimeter, implementing the process of connecting and disconnecting the leads onto the terminal, having a functional display mimicking the tested voltage and giving objects a “voltage” that can be probed by the Multimeter to accurately mimic a working multimeter. This was used in the later stages of the project to reduce the crunch time needed to resolve issues with implementation as the Multimeter and Hoist are one of the hardest to implement and implementing it during a time of reduced motivation near the end would not be ideal. Additionally, I also utilised components that my teammates also worked on. This includes the UX flow and how players should be introduced to each component through research and testing by the UX Specialist, replacing low fidelity prototypes developed by myself or placeholders with actual HD models, compiling documentation for the Project Manager and merging components built by other developers. \n' +
        '            <h3>Code Consolidation and Mission Manager</h3>\n' +
        '            As the project expanded and more components started to have dependencies on other components, we needed a way to consolidate everything together and reorganise the codebase. One solution is to use Object Oriented Programming to implement a Mission Manager system. We start with a Mission Manager that keeps track of all tasks. Each Task inherits a base class called a Task Supervisor. It has its own implementation along with inherited methods to keep track of the current Tasks and triggered Colliders that cue the next set of actions to be taken. Once all the subtasks inside of a Task are completed, a call to Mission Manager is made to tell the Manager to cue the next Task and disable everything that is used in that Task to save system resources. For each task, a set of events (EventTrigger_C) is executed to allow for the display of UI elements for the UX flow, and to set up object states for the current or next subtask. Each EventTrigger_C has two fields, TGB() and UI Only(). TGB() events are triggered regardless of whether or not it is a UI element. These events set up the required elements; for example the position of the hoist, or the player’s position. UI Only events are concerned for the display of vital UI elements for the purposes of the training and tutorial mode in the game, where players are provided UI cues to aid in the dissemination of vital training information. \n' +

        '            <h3>Project Overview</h3> \n' +
        '\n' +
        'In this project, our team of six people with two developers, one UX specialist, one environment designer, one 3D modeller and a project manager undertook a mission to develop an immersive virtual reality experience to train upcoming mechanics to replace a battery electric vehicle main battery. Our client was for the Vancouver Community College’s automotive training program, and we wanted to best replicate a realistic Ev battery simulation that complies with their standards for properly and in an engaging way, train students to perform the task and practice in a safe controlled environment before allowing them to perform the task in a real setting.\n' +
        '            <h3>Contribution</h3>\n' +
        '            The hoist with functional buttons and multimeter with functional dials and voltage capture. The hoist behaves exactly as the one shown by our client at VCC. The big button lifts the load, a small lever near the hydraulic tank lowers the hoist and a safety interlock mechanically latches the vehicle based on preset spots on the lift, locking it securely in the event of hydraulics failure. I also worked on the Multimeter, implementing the process of connecting and disconnecting the leads onto the terminal, having a functional display mimicking the tested voltage and giving objects a “voltage” that can be probed by the Multimeter to accurately mimic a working multimeter. This was used in the later stages of the project to reduce the crunch time needed to resolve issues with implementation as the Multimeter and Hoist are one of the hardest to implement and implementing it during a time of reduced motivation near the end would not be ideal. Additionally, I also utilised components that my teammates also worked on. This includes the UX flow and how players should be introduced to each component through research and testing by the UX Specialist, replacing low fidelity prototypes developed by myself or placeholders with actual HD models, compiling documentation for the Project Manager and merging components built by other developers. \n' +
        '            <h3>Code Consolidation and Mission Manager</h3>\n' +
        '            As the project expanded and more components started to have dependencies on other components, we needed a way to consolidate everything together and reorganise the codebase. One solution is to use Object Oriented Programming to implement a Mission Manager system. We start with a Mission Manager that keeps track of all tasks. Each Task inherits a base class called a Task Supervisor. It has its own implementation along with inherited methods to keep track of the current Tasks and triggered Colliders that cue the next set of actions to be taken. Once all the subtasks inside of a Task are completed, a call to Mission Manager is made to tell the Manager to cue the next Task and disable everything that is used in that Task to save system resources. For each task, a set of events (EventTrigger_C) is executed to allow for the display of UI elements for the UX flow, and to set up object states for the current or next subtask. Each EventTrigger_C has two fields, TGB() and UI Only(). TGB() events are triggered regardless of whether or not it is a UI element. These events set up the required elements; for example the position of the hoist, or the player’s position. UI Only events are concerned for the display of vital UI elements for the purposes of the training and tutorial mode in the game, where players are provided UI cues to aid in the dissemination of vital training information. \n' +

They set up the model, pass arguments through the linear algebra functions to set up the view and projection matrices and transform them to view space to be displayed on screen. The only concern is that for many objects in scene, we have to do that for every single object, so we use OOP to streamline and modularize the project for larger scenes, inspired by Unity's GameObject and Scene system.\n" +

This was used in the later stages of the project to reduce the crunch time needed to resolve issues with implementation as the Multimeter and Hoist are one of the hardest to implement and implementing it during a time of reduced motivation near the end would not be ideal. Additionally, I also utilised components that my teammates also worked on. This includes the UX flow and how players should be introduced to each component through research and testing by the UX Specialist, replacing low fidelity prototypes developed by myself or placeholders with actual HD models, compiling documentation for the Project Manager and merging components built by other developers. \n' +
        '            <h3>Code Consolidation and Mission Manager</h3>\n' +
        '            As the project expanded and more components started to have dependencies on other components, we needed a way to consolidate everything together and reorganise the codebase. One solution is to use Object Oriented Programming to implement a Mission Manager system. We start with a Mission Manager that keeps track of all tasks. Each Task inherits a base class called a Task Supervisor. It has its own implementation along with inherited methods to keep track of the current Tasks and triggered Colliders that cue the next set of actions to be taken. Once all the subtasks inside of a Task are completed, a call to Mission Manager is made to tell the Manager to cue the next Task and disable everything that is used in that Task to save system resources. For each task, a set of events (EventTrigger_C) is executed to allow for the display of UI elements for the UX flow, and to set up object states for the current or next subtask. Each EventTrigger_C has two fields, TGB() and UI Only(). TGB() events are triggered regardless of whether or not it is a UI element. These events set up the required elements; for example the position of the hoist, or the player’s position. UI Only events are concerned for the display of vital UI elements for the purposes of the training and tutorial mode in the game, where players are provided UI cues to aid in the dissemination of vital training information. \n' +

        '            <h3>Project Overview</h3> \n' +
        '\n' +
        'In this project, our team of six people with two developers, one UX specialist, one environment designer, one 3D modeller and a project manager undertook a mission to develop an immersive virtual reality experience to train upcoming mechanics to replace a battery electric vehicle main battery. Our client was for the Vancouver Community College’s automotive training program, and we wanted to best replicate a realistic Ev battery simulation that complies with their standards for properly and in an engaging way, train students to perform the task and practice in a safe controlled environment before allowing them to perform the task in a real setting.\n' +
        '            <h3>Contribution</h3>\n' +
        '            The hoist with functional buttons and multimeter with functional dials and voltage capture. The hoist behaves exactly as the one shown by our client at VCC. The big button lifts the load, a small lever near the hydraulic tank lowers the hoist and a safety interlock mechanically latches the vehicle based on preset spots on the lift, locking it securely in the event of hydraulics failure. I also worked on the Multimeter, implementing the process of connecting and disconnecting the leads onto the terminal, having a functional display mimicking the tested voltage and giving objects a “voltage” that can be probed by the Multimeter to accurately mimic a working multimeter. This was used in the later stages of the project to reduce the crunch time needed to resolve issues with implementation as the Multimeter and Hoist are one of the hardest to implement and implementing it during a time of reduced motivation near the end would not be ideal. Additionally, I also utilised components that my teammates also worked on. This includes the UX flow and how players should be introduced to each component through research and testing by the UX Specialist, replacing low fidelity prototypes developed by myself or placeholders with actual HD models, compiling documentation for the Project Manager and merging components built by other developers. \n' +
        '            <h3>Code Consolidation and Mission Manager</h3>\n' +
        '            As the project expanded and more components started to have dependencies on other components, we needed a way to consolidate everything together and reorganise the codebase. One solution is to use Object Oriented Programming to implement a Mission Manager system. We start with a Mission Manager that keeps track of all tasks. Each Task inherits a base class called a Task Supervisor. It has its own implementation along with inherited methods to keep track of the current Tasks and triggered Colliders that cue the next set of actions to be taken. Once all the subtasks inside of a Task are completed, a call to Mission Manager is made to tell the Manager to cue the next Task and disable everything that is used in that Task to save system resources. For each task, a set of events (EventTrigger_C) is executed to allow for the display of UI elements for the UX flow, and to set up object states for the current or next subtask. Each EventTrigger_C has two fields, TGB() and UI Only(). TGB() events are triggered regardless of whether or not it is a UI element. These events set up the required elements; for example the position of the hoist, or the player’s position. UI Only events are concerned for the display of vital UI elements for the purposes of the training and tutorial mode in the game, where players are provided UI cues to aid in the dissemination of vital training information. \n' +

        '            <h3>Project Overview</h3> \n' +
        '\n' +
        'In this project, our team of six people with two developers, one UX specialist, one environment designer, one 3D modeller and a project manager undertook a mission to develop an immersive virtual reality experience to train upcoming mechanics to replace a battery electric vehicle main battery. Our client was for the Vancouver Community College’s automotive training program, and we wanted to best replicate a realistic Ev battery simulation that complies with their standards for properly and in an engaging way, train students to perform the task and practice in a safe controlled environment before allowing them to perform the task in a real setting.\n' +
        '            <h3>Contribution</h3>\n' +
        '            The hoist with functional buttons and multimeter with functional dials and voltage capture. The hoist behaves exactly as the one shown by our client at VCC. The big button lifts the load, a small lever near the hydraulic tank lowers the hoist and a safety interlock mechanically latches the vehicle based on preset spots on the lift, locking it securely in the event of hydraulics failure. I also worked on the Multimeter, implementing the process of connecting and disconnecting the leads onto the terminal, having a functional display mimicking the tested voltage and giving objects a “voltage” that can be probed by the Multimeter to accurately mimic a working multimeter. This was used in the later stages of the project to reduce the crunch time needed to resolve issues with implementation as the Multimeter and Hoist are one of the hardest to implement and implementing it during a time of reduced motivation near the end would not be ideal. Additionally, I also utilised components that my teammates also worked on. This includes the UX flow and how players should be introduced to each component through research and testing by the UX Specialist, replacing low fidelity prototypes developed by myself or placeholders with actual HD models, compiling documentation for the Project Manager and merging components built by other developers. \n' +
        '            <h3>Code Consolidation and Mission Manager</h3>\n' +
        '            As the project expanded and more components started to have dependencies on other components, we needed a way to consolidate everything together and reorganise the codebase. One solution is to use Object Oriented Programming to implement a Mission Manager system. We start with a Mission Manager that keeps track of all tasks. Each Task inherits a base class called a Task Supervisor. It has its own implementation along with inherited methods to keep track of the current Tasks and triggered Colliders that cue the next set of actions to be taken. Once all the subtasks inside of a Task are completed, a call to Mission Manager is made to tell the Manager to cue the next Task and disable everything that is used in that Task to save system resources. For each task, a set of events (EventTrigger_C) is executed to allow for the display of UI elements for the UX flow, and to set up object states for the current or next subtask. Each EventTrigger_C has two fields, TGB() and UI Only(). TGB() events are triggered regardless of whether or not it is a UI element. These events set up the required elements; for example the position of the hoist, or the player’s position. UI Only events are concerned for the display of vital UI elements for the purposes of the training and tutorial mode in the game, where players are provided UI cues to aid in the dissemination of vital training information. \n' +

They set up the model, pass arguments through the linear algebra functions to set up the view and projection matrices and transform them to view space to be displayed on screen. The only concern is that for many objects in scene, we have to do that for every single object, so we use OOP to streamline and modularize the project for larger scenes, inspired by Unity's GameObject and Scene system.\n" +

        '\n' +
        'In this project, our team of six people with two developers, one UX specialist, one environment designer, one 3D modeller and a project manager undertook a mission to develop an immersive virtual reality experience to train upcoming mechanics to replace a battery electric vehicle main battery. Our client was for the Vancouver Community College’s automotive training program, and we wanted to best replicate a realistic Ev battery simulation that complies with their standards for properly and in an engaging way, train students to perform the task and practice in a safe controlled environment before allowing them to perform the task in a real setting.\n' +

        '            The hoist with functional buttons and multimeter with functional dials and voltage capture. The hoist behaves exactly as the one shown by our client at VCC. The big button lifts the load, a small lever near the hydraulic tank lowers the hoist and a safety interlock mechanically latches the vehicle based on preset spots on the lift, locking it securely in the event of hydraulics failure. I also worked on the Multimeter, implementing the process of connecting and disconnecting the leads onto the terminal, having a functional display mimicking the tested voltage and giving objects a “voltage” that can be probed by the Multimeter to accurately mimic a working multimeter. This was used in the later stages of the project to reduce the crunch time needed to resolve issues with implementation as the Multimeter and Hoist are one of the hardest to implement and implementing it during a time of reduced motivation near the end would not be ideal. Additionally, I also utilised components that my teammates also worked on. This includes the UX flow and how players should be introduced to each component through research and testing by the UX Specialist, replacing low fidelity prototypes developed by myself or placeholders with actual HD models, compiling documentation for the Project Manager and merging components built by other developers. \n' +

        '            As the project expanded and more components started to have dependencies on other components, we needed a way to consolidate everything together and reorganise the codebase. One solution is to use Object Oriented Programming to implement a Mission Manager system. We start with a Mission Manager that keeps track of all tasks. Each Task inherits a base class called a Task Supervisor. It has its own implementation along with inherited methods to keep track of the current Tasks and triggered Colliders that cue the next set of actions to be taken. Once all the subtasks inside of a Task are completed, a call to Mission Manager is made to tell the Manager to cue the next Task and disable everything that is used in that Task to save system resources. For each task, a set of events (EventTrigger_C) is executed to allow for the display of UI elements for the UX flow, and to set up object states for the current or next subtask. Each EventTrigger_C has two fields, TGB() and UI Only(). TGB() events are triggered regardless of whether or not it is a UI element. These events set up the required elements; for example the position of the hoist, or the player’s position. UI Only events are concerned for the display of vital UI elements for the purposes of the training and tutorial mode in the game, where players are provided UI cues to aid in the dissemination of vital training information. \n' +

        '            <h3>Project Overview</h3> \n' +
        '\n' +
        'In this project, our team of six people with two developers, one UX specialist, one environment designer, one 3D modeller and a project manager undertook a mission to develop an immersive virtual reality experience to train upcoming mechanics to replace a battery electric vehicle main battery. Our client was for the Vancouver Community College’s automotive training program, and we wanted to best replicate a realistic Ev battery simulation that complies with their standards for properly and in an engaging way, train students to perform the task and practice in a safe controlled environment before allowing them to perform the task in a real setting.\n' +
        '            <h3>Contribution</h3>\n' +
        '            The hoist with functional buttons and multimeter with functional dials and voltage capture. The hoist behaves exactly as the one shown by our client at VCC. The big button lifts the load, a small lever near the hydraulic tank lowers the hoist and a safety interlock mechanically latches the vehicle based on preset spots on the lift, locking it securely in the event of hydraulics failure. I also worked on the Multimeter, implementing the process of connecting and disconnecting the leads onto the terminal, having a functional display mimicking the tested voltage and giving objects a “voltage” that can be probed by the Multimeter to accurately mimic a working multimeter. This was used in the later stages of the project to reduce the crunch time needed to resolve issues with implementation as the Multimeter and Hoist are one of the hardest to implement and implementing it during a time of reduced motivation near the end would not be ideal. Additionally, I also utilised components that my teammates also worked on. This includes the UX flow and how players should be introduced to each component through research and testing by the UX Specialist, replacing low fidelity prototypes developed by myself or placeholders with actual HD models, compiling documentation for the Project Manager and merging components built by other developers. \n' +
        '            <h3>Code Consolidation and Mission Manager</h3>\n' +
        '            As the project expanded and more components started to have dependencies on other components, we needed a way to consolidate everything together and reorganise the codebase. One solution is to use Object Oriented Programming to implement a Mission Manager system. We start with a Mission Manager that keeps track of all tasks. Each Task inherits a base class called a Task Supervisor. It has its own implementation along with inherited methods to keep track of the current Tasks and triggered Colliders that cue the next set of actions to be taken. Once all the subtasks inside of a Task are completed, a call to Mission Manager is made to tell the Manager to cue the next Task and disable everything that is used in that Task to save system resources. For each task, a set of events (EventTrigger_C) is executed to allow for the display of UI elements for the UX flow, and to set up object states for the current or next subtask. Each EventTrigger_C has two fields, TGB() and UI Only(). TGB() events are triggered regardless of whether or not it is a UI element. These events set up the required elements; for example the position of the hoist, or the player’s position. UI Only events are concerned for the display of vital UI elements for the purposes of the training and tutorial mode in the game, where players are provided UI cues to aid in the dissemination of vital training information. \n' +

        '<h3>Use of OOP (Object Oriented Programming)</h3>\n' +
        "In previous iterations of the project, rendering is done through function calls. They set up the model, pass arguments through the linear algebra functions to set up the view and projection matrices and transform them to view space to be displayed on screen. The only concern is that for many objects in scene, we have to do that for every single object, so we use OOP to streamline and modularize the project for larger scenes, inspired by Unity's GameObject and Scene system.\n" +

        '            <h3>Project Overview</h3> \n' +
        '\n' +
        'In this project, our team of six people with two developers, one UX specialist, one environment designer, one 3D modeller and a project manager undertook a mission to develop an immersive virtual reality experience to train upcoming mechanics to replace a battery electric vehicle main battery. Our client was for the Vancouver Community College’s automotive training program, and we wanted to best replicate a realistic Ev battery simulation that complies with their standards for properly and in an engaging way, train students to perform the task and practice in a safe controlled environment before allowing them to perform the task in a real setting.\n' +
        '            <h3>Contribution</h3>\n' +
        '            The hoist with functional buttons and multimeter with functional dials and voltage capture. The hoist behaves exactly as the one shown by our client at VCC. The big button lifts the load, a small lever near the hydraulic tank lowers the hoist and a safety interlock mechanically latches the vehicle based on preset spots on the lift, locking it securely in the event of hydraulics failure. I also worked on the Multimeter, implementing the process of connecting and disconnecting the leads onto the terminal, having a functional display mimicking the tested voltage and giving objects a “voltage” that can be probed by the Multimeter to accurately mimic a working multimeter. This was used in the later stages of the project to reduce the crunch time needed to resolve issues with implementation as the Multimeter and Hoist are one of the hardest to implement and implementing it during a time of reduced motivation near the end would not be ideal. Additionally, I also utilised components that my teammates also worked on. This includes the UX flow and how players should be introduced to each component through research and testing by the UX Specialist, replacing low fidelity prototypes developed by myself or placeholders with actual HD models, compiling documentation for the Project Manager and merging components built by other developers. \n' +
        '            <h3>Code Consolidation and Mission Manager</h3>\n' +
        '            As the project expanded and more components started to have dependencies on other components, we needed a way to consolidate everything together and reorganise the codebase. One solution is to use Object Oriented Programming to implement a Mission Manager system. We start with a Mission Manager that keeps track of all tasks. Each Task inherits a base class called a Task Supervisor. It has its own implementation along with inherited methods to keep track of the current Tasks and triggered Colliders that cue the next set of actions to be taken. Once all the subtasks inside of a Task are completed, a call to Mission Manager is made to tell the Manager to cue the next Task and disable everything that is used in that Task to save system resources. For each task, a set of events (EventTrigger_C) is executed to allow for the display of UI elements for the UX flow, and to set up object states for the current or next subtask. Each EventTrigger_C has two fields, TGB() and UI Only(). TGB() events are triggered regardless of whether or not it is a UI element. These events set up the required elements; for example the position of the hoist, or the player’s position. UI Only events are concerned for the display of vital UI elements for the purposes of the training and tutorial mode in the game, where players are provided UI cues to aid in the dissemination of vital training information. \n' +

They set up the model, pass arguments through the linear algebra functions to set up the view and projection matrices and transform them to view space to be displayed on screen. The only concern is that for many objects in scene, we have to do that for every single object, so we use OOP to streamline and modularize the project for larger scenes, inspired by Unity's GameObject and Scene system.\n" +

        '\n' +
        'In this project, our team of six people with two developers, one UX specialist, one environment designer, one 3D modeller and a project manager undertook a mission to develop an immersive virtual reality experience to train upcoming mechanics to replace a battery electric vehicle main battery. Our client was for the Vancouver Community College’s automotive training program, and we wanted to best replicate a realistic Ev battery simulation that complies with their standards for properly and in an engaging way, train students to perform the task and practice in a safe controlled environment before allowing them to perform the task in a real setting.\n' +
        '            <h3>Contribution</h3>\n' +
        '            The hoist with functional buttons and multimeter with functional dials and voltage capture. The hoist behaves exactly as the one shown by our client at VCC. The big button lifts the load, a small lever near the hydraulic tank lowers the hoist and a safety interlock mechanically latches the vehicle based on preset spots on the lift, locking it securely in the event of hydraulics failure. I also worked on the Multimeter, implementing the process of connecting and disconnecting the leads onto the terminal, having a functional display mimicking the tested voltage and giving objects a “voltage” that can be probed by the Multimeter to accurately mimic a working multimeter. This was used in the later stages of the project to reduce the crunch time needed to resolve issues with implementation as the Multimeter and Hoist are one of the hardest to implement and implementing it during a time of reduced motivation near the end would not be ideal. Additionally, I also utilised components that my teammates also worked on. This includes the UX flow and how players should be introduced to each component through research and testing by the UX Specialist, replacing low fidelity prototypes developed by myself or placeholders with actual HD models, compiling documentation for the Project Manager and merging components built by other developers. \n' +
        '            <h3>Code Consolidation and Mission Manager</h3>\n' +
        '            As the project expanded and more components started to have dependencies on other components, we needed a way to consolidate everything together and reorganise the codebase. One solution is to use Object Oriented Programming to implement a Mission Manager system. We start with a Mission Manager that keeps track of all tasks. Each Task inherits a base class called a Task Supervisor. It has its own implementation along with inherited methods to keep track of the current Tasks and triggered Colliders that cue the next set of actions to be taken. Once all the subtasks inside of a Task are completed, a call to Mission Manager is made to tell the Manager to cue the next Task and disable everything that is used in that Task to save system resources. For each task, a set of events (EventTrigger_C) is executed to allow for the display of UI elements for the UX flow, and to set up object states for the current or next subtask. Each EventTrigger_C has two fields, TGB() and UI Only(). TGB() events are triggered regardless of whether or not it is a UI element. These events set up the required elements; for example the position of the hoist, or the player’s position. UI Only events are concerned for the display of vital UI elements for the purposes of the training and tutorial mode in the game, where players are provided UI cues to aid in the dissemination of vital training information. \n' +

        '\n' +
        'In this project, our team of six people with two developers, one UX specialist, one environment designer, one 3D modeller and a project manager undertook a mission to develop an immersive virtual reality experience to train upcoming mechanics to replace a battery electric vehicle main battery. Our client was for the Vancouver Community College’s automotive training program, and we wanted to best replicate a realistic Ev battery simulation that complies with their standards for properly and in an engaging way, train students to perform the task and practice in a safe controlled environment before allowing them to perform the task in a real setting.\n' +

        '            The hoist with functional buttons and multimeter with functional dials and voltage capture. The hoist behaves exactly as the one shown by our client at VCC. The big button lifts the load, a small lever near the hydraulic tank lowers the hoist and a safety interlock mechanically latches the vehicle based on preset spots on the lift, locking it securely in the event of hydraulics failure. I also worked on the Multimeter, implementing the process of connecting and disconnecting the leads onto the terminal, having a functional display mimicking the tested voltage and giving objects a “voltage” that can be probed by the Multimeter to accurately mimic a working multimeter. This was used in the later stages of the project to reduce the crunch time needed to resolve issues with implementation as the Multimeter and Hoist are one of the hardest to implement and implementing it during a time of reduced motivation near the end would not be ideal. Additionally, I also utilised components that my teammates also worked on. This includes the UX flow and how players should be introduced to each component through research and testing by the UX Specialist, replacing low fidelity prototypes developed by myself or placeholders with actual HD models, compiling documentation for the Project Manager and merging components built by other developers. \n' +
        '            <h3>Code Consolidation and Mission Manager</h3>\n' +
        '            As the project expanded and more components started to have dependencies on other components, we needed a way to consolidate everything together and reorganise the codebase. One solution is to use Object Oriented Programming to implement a Mission Manager system. We start with a Mission Manager that keeps track of all tasks. Each Task inherits a base class called a Task Supervisor. It has its own implementation along with inherited methods to keep track of the current Tasks and triggered Colliders that cue the next set of actions to be taken. Once all the subtasks inside of a Task are completed, a call to Mission Manager is made to tell the Manager to cue the next Task and disable everything that is used in that Task to save system resources. For each task, a set of events (EventTrigger_C) is executed to allow for the display of UI elements for the UX flow, and to set up object states for the current or next subtask. Each EventTrigger_C has two fields, TGB() and UI Only(). TGB() events are triggered regardless of whether or not it is a UI element. These events set up the required elements; for example the position of the hoist, or the player’s position. UI Only events are concerned for the display of vital UI elements for the purposes of the training and tutorial mode in the game, where players are provided UI cues to aid in the dissemination of vital training information. \n' +

        '            <h3>Project Overview</h3> \n' +
        '\n' +
        'In this project, our team of six people with two developers, one UX specialist, one environment designer, one 3D modeller and a project manager undertook a mission to develop an immersive virtual reality experience to train upcoming mechanics to replace a battery electric vehicle main battery. Our client was for the Vancouver Community College’s automotive training program, and we wanted to best replicate a realistic Ev battery simulation that complies with their standards for properly and in an engaging way, train students to perform the task and practice in a safe controlled environment before allowing them to perform the task in a real setting.\n' +
        '            <h3>Contribution</h3>\n' +
        '            The hoist with functional buttons and multimeter with functional dials and voltage capture. The hoist behaves exactly as the one shown by our client at VCC. The big button lifts the load, a small lever near the hydraulic tank lowers the hoist and a safety interlock mechanically latches the vehicle based on preset spots on the lift, locking it securely in the event of hydraulics failure. I also worked on the Multimeter, implementing the process of connecting and disconnecting the leads onto the terminal, having a functional display mimicking the tested voltage and giving objects a “voltage” that can be probed by the Multimeter to accurately mimic a working multimeter. This was used in the later stages of the project to reduce the crunch time needed to resolve issues with implementation as the Multimeter and Hoist are one of the hardest to implement and implementing it during a time of reduced motivation near the end would not be ideal. Additionally, I also utilised components that my teammates also worked on. This includes the UX flow and how players should be introduced to each component through research and testing by the UX Specialist, replacing low fidelity prototypes developed by myself or placeholders with actual HD models, compiling documentation for the Project Manager and merging components built by other developers. \n' +
        '            <h3>Code Consolidation and Mission Manager</h3>\n' +
        '            As the project expanded and more components started to have dependencies on other components, we needed a way to consolidate everything together and reorganise the codebase. One solution is to use Object Oriented Programming to implement a Mission Manager system. We start with a Mission Manager that keeps track of all tasks. Each Task inherits a base class called a Task Supervisor. It has its own implementation along with inherited methods to keep track of the current Tasks and triggered Colliders that cue the next set of actions to be taken. Once all the subtasks inside of a Task are completed, a call to Mission Manager is made to tell the Manager to cue the next Task and disable everything that is used in that Task to save system resources. For each task, a set of events (EventTrigger_C) is executed to allow for the display of UI elements for the UX flow, and to set up object states for the current or next subtask. Each EventTrigger_C has two fields, TGB() and UI Only(). TGB() events are triggered regardless of whether or not it is a UI element. These events set up the required elements; for example the position of the hoist, or the player’s position. UI Only events are concerned for the display of vital UI elements for the purposes of the training and tutorial mode in the game, where players are provided UI cues to aid in the dissemination of vital training information. \n' +

        '<h3>Use of OOP (Object Oriented Programming)</h3>\n' +
        "In previous iterations of the project, rendering is done through function calls. They set up the model, pass arguments through the linear algebra functions to set up the view and projection matrices and transform them to view space to be displayed on screen. The only concern is that for many objects in scene, we have to do that for every single object, so we use OOP to streamline and modularize the project for larger scenes, inspired by Unity's GameObject and Scene system.\n" +
